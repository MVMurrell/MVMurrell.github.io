    <h1>What is Math?</h1>

    <p>In the java.lang package there is a class called "Math" that contains
      methods to perform different mathematical operations. In order to call
      this class correctly we must capitalize the first letter of math. The
      are over 50 methods in this class, one of which is the "static double-
      random" method which we call with "random". This "Math.random()" method
      returns a random, postivie, double-type number with a value greater than or equal
      to 0 and less than 1(0 to .9999999)

      Once this random number is generated we can maniupulate the value to our
      needs. Using multiplication we can set a range for our values, for example:

            12*Math.random() gives us a range from 0 to 11.99

      (int) then removes the decimal places so that we have a solid number

            (int)Math.random()*12 gives us 0 to 11.

      And then addition will give us our minimum value for the range

          5 + (int)Math.random()*12 gives us 5 to 16

      That's the general use for "Math.random()". Use the above example to
      experiment with the "Math.random()" method in your work.
