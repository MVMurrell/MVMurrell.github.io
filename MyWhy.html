    <h1>What is my Why</h1>

    <p>I've been down a few different roads (as I'm sure many have),
      and while traveling down those roads I've had a very particular objective
      in which I was seeking to accomplish. The objective was to find something
      that I coud do really well, that I enjoyed, and that made some sort of
      positive impact on the world. In my last endeavor, I owned a ski mountain
      shuttle business. I thought, "This was it, whis will bring the sense of
      fulfillment I've been looking for" only to find that I was miserable
      after just a year of operation. I knew that it wasn't the right fit
      for me after the first 3 months, but I stuck with it to see what else it
      may bring. Not much changed after those three months but there was a caveat
      to the failed mountain shuttle business. During the first few months I
      did some front end developement for the company website and really enjoyed it.
      I kept thinking, " If there was money in this, I would do it all the
      time"...silly me. But, let's rewind a little bit to 2016 when I came
      across cryptocurrency investing. This was really interesting, as my
      Bachelor's is in Finance with a focus on Investments. I did a bunch of
      reasearch on blockchain and the potential of it's applications to solve
      problems around the world. At the time, being involved on any level other
      than just a spectator/investing level seemed far fetched.</p>

      <p>A few months ago I was brought on as Denver Ambassador for a blockchain
      group called Ã†ternity. I'd prefer to develop. The problem right now with
      blockchain is that people don't know how to use it, and frankly, it's
      not user friendly. So, we need developers to put together awesome
      applications that people enjoy using just as much or better than their
      current fiat currency-based apps.  This is what I want to do.  Without
      developers who aren't afraid to step over into the realm of blockchain,
      the positive impact that this technology can have wont be felt as quickly.</p>
